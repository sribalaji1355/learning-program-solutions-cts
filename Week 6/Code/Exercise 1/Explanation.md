# 📘 Theory: React & SPA Basics

## 1. Define SPA and Its Benefits

A **Single Page Application (SPA)** is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content without refreshing the entire page.

**Benefits:**
- Faster navigation and better performance after the initial load
- Smooth and seamless user experience
- Reduced bandwidth usage
- Enhanced responsiveness (like a desktop app)

## 2. Define React and Identify Its Working

**React** is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces using a **component-based architecture**.

It works by:
- Breaking the UI into reusable components
- Using JSX (JavaScript + XML syntax)
- Leveraging a **Virtual DOM** to optimize rendering

## 3. Differences Between SPA and MPA

| Feature           | SPA (Single Page App)         | MPA (Multi Page App)          |
|------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Page Loads       | Only once                     | Every page interaction        |
| Routing          | Client-side (via JavaScript)  | Server-side (new HTTP request)|
| Speed            | Faster after first load       | Slower due to full reloads    |
| User Experience  | Smooth and dynamic            | Traditional and static        |
| SEO              | More challenging              | Better suited for SEO         |

## 4. Pros and Cons of Single Page Applications

### ✅ Pros:
- Faster and more responsive
- Better UX with no page reloads
- Can cache data for offline use
- Ideal for mobile apps and dashboards

### ❌ Cons:
- SEO is harder to implement
- Initial load can be heavy
- JavaScript errors may break the whole app
- Browser history and analytics need more handling

## 5. Explain About React

React is used for building modern web applications by composing complex UIs from small, isolated pieces called **components**.

It is declarative, meaning you describe how the UI should look for a given state, and React ensures it updates efficiently when the data changes.

---

## 6. Define Virtual DOM

The **Virtual DOM (VDOM)** is an in-memory representation of the real DOM. When changes occur:
- React updates the Virtual DOM first
- Then calculates the minimal number of real DOM changes (using a diffing algorithm)
- Applies only those changes to the actual DOM (called *reconciliation*)

This makes updates fast and efficient.
